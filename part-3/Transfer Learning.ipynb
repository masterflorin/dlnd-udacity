    "### Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a technique of using a pre-trained model with its parameters on a dataset. What does **pre-trained model** mean? These are models that have already been trained on a different dataset, most commonly [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) due to the size of the database and number of classes (1000). Due to the sheer volume of data, these sort of models are difficult to train as they take a very long time even weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Famous architectures: VGG, ResNet, DenseNet etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, what transfer learning allows us is to make good use of an already trained model and apply the knowledge on another task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering transfer learning it is important to recognize that a pre-trained model has already been trained for a certain dataset so in order to get the most out of it we would have to replace the last layers because they were already doing a very specialized task so unless our dataset is very similar we will replace it and train only the **classifier** (last layer). Therefore we can use the model as a **feature detector** that has already one most of the work and correlate those outputs with the newly trained classifier. Below an example of VGG model.\n",
