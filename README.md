# Welcome to my Deep Learning Nanodegree

## About

I built this repository in order to keep track of what I learned from the nanodegree. This repository includes mostly notes and some noteboks with algorithm implementations as exercises.

## Installation

While a lot of the repository contains notes in markdown and in jupyter notebooks, for those that have significant code if you would like to run it I recommend you install the dependencies from the Udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch#dependencies) for the Deep Learning Nanodegree. I used the same one for this repo.

## Issues
**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**: It's very likely that not all links are working, images require formatting, and not all notebooks with code have been filled in yet.

## Disclaimer

Throughout this repo I have made use of Udacity course material, including screenshots of concepts from their videos. I would like to emphasize that I'm only using them for educational purposes due to their high quality and I'm not going to use them for profit or any commercial activity. Thank you!

## TODO
- [ ] Adjust image sizes
- [ ] Add documentation files
- [ ] Add link to projects repo
- [ ] Create a project site for the repository
