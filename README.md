# Welcome to my Deep Learning Nanodegree

### About

I built this repository in order to keep track of what I learned from the nanodegree. I included only notes, algorithm implementations, notebooks and some other stuff but not the projects.

### Table of contents

- [Intro to Deep Learning](part-1/Intro_to_NumPy.ipynb)
- Neural Networks
	- [Introduction to Neural Networks](part-2/Introduction_to_Neural_Networks.ipynb)
	- [Implementing Gradient Descent](part-2/Implementing_Gradient_Descent.ipynb)
	- [Training Neural Networks](part-2/Training_Neural_Networks.ipynb)
	- [Sentiment Analysis](part-2/sentiment-analysis-network/Sentiment_Classification_Projects.ipynb)
	- [Deep Learning with PyTorch](part-2/intro-to-pytorch)
- Convolutional Neural Networks
	- [Convolutional Neural Networks](part-3/Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Notes.ipynb)
		- [CNN Architectures](part-3/CNN_Architectures.ipynb)
	- [Transfer Learning](part-3/Transfer_Learning_Notes.ipynb)
	- [Weight Initialization](part-3/Weight_Initialization_Notes.ipynb)
	- [Autoencoders](part-3/Autoencoders_notes.ipynb)
	- Style Transfer

- Extra
	- [Evaluation Metrics](extra/Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb)
	- [Regression](extra/Regression.ipynb)

### Installation

While a lot of the repository contains notes in markdown and in jupyter notebooks, for those that have significant code if you would like to run it I recommend you install the dependencies from the Udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch#dependencies) for the Deep Learning Nanodegree. I used the same one for this repo.

### Issues
**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**: It's very likely that not all links are working, images require formatting, and not all notebooks with code have been filled in. In any case, stay tuned.

### TODO
- [ ] Adjust image sizes
- [ ] Add documentation files
- [ ] Add link to projects repo
- [ ] Create a project site for the repository
