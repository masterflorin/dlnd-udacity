# Welcome to my Deep Learning Nanodegree

## About

I built this repository in order to keep track of what I learned from the nanodegree. This repository includes mostly notes and some noteboks with algorithm implementations as exercises. 

## Table of contents

#### Intro to Deep Learning

Summary: In this chapter, you learn about the basic tools needed to understand Deep Learning. It includes an introduction to Numpy and operations involving scalars, vectors and matrices that are very useful.

- [Introduction to Numpy](part-1/Intro_to_NumPy.ipynb)

#### Neural Networks

Summary: In this chapter you learn the fundamentals of neural networks, why and how do they work. It also includes a deep dive into what is gradient descent and how to implement it using only Python and Numpy without relying on any machine learning library.

## Installation

While a lot of the repository contains notes in markdown and in jupyter notebooks, for those that have significant code if you would like to run it I recommend you install the dependencies from the Udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch#dependencies) for the Deep Learning Nanodegree. I used the same one for this repo.

## Issues
**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**: It's very likely that not all links are working, images require formatting, and not all notebooks with code have been filled in yet.

## Disclaimer

Throughout this repo I have made use of Udacity course material, including screenshots of concepts from their videos. I would like to emphasize that I'm only using them for educational purposes due to their high quality and I'm not going to use them for profit or any commercial activity. Thank you!
