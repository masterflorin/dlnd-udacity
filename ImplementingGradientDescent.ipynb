    "In the Introduction to Neural Networks, we learned about Cross Entropy as a loss function. In this notebook I've taken notes about another error function, the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\mu} \\sum_{j} [y^{\\mu}_{j}−y^{\\mu}_{i}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes about the equation:\n",
    "- The inside sums over j. This variable represents the output units of the network.\n",
    "- The outer sum over $\\mu$, where it represents all the data points.\n",
    "- It's basically taking the average over the squared differences between the label and the prediction.\n",
    "- Particularly useful because it ensures that the errors that are always larger and positive get more penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the output of the network is dependent on the weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y^{\\mu}_{j} = f(\\sum_{i} w_{ij} x^{\\mu}_{i} )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is used in the error function as a way of quantifying the error rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\mu} \\sum_{j} \\left[y^{\\mu}_{j}−f\\left(\\sum_{i} w_{ij} x^{\\mu}_{i}\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since the goal is to find the weights that minimize the error, this is where Gradient descent comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent for the SSE for a neural network can be defined: $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{i}}= -(y - \\hat{y})f'(h)$, which can be broken down into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(y - \\hat{y})$ - output error, \n",
    "- $f'(h)$ refers to the derivative of the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "then the weight step is: $w_{i} = \\eta(y - \\hat{y})f'(h)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience an Error Term can be defined: $\\delta= (y - \\hat{y})f'(h)$\n",
    "\n",
    "then the weight update can be written as: $w_{i} = w_{i} + \\eta\\delta x_{i}$"
